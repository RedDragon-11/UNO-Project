# UNO-Project
This is a simple project that I took on to help teach me some OOP with python 
Its not going to be perfect and could probably be done in a more effectient manner but this project is one of my first full projects with Python!
As a warning, some cards might not function properly (i.e. Skips). I am currently still working on it and they should be implimented soon.

####-----How to RUN------####
1. Make sure you have Python installed (pretty sure it must be at least Python 3)
2. Right Click main.py and open with Python
3. Enjoy my simplistic little 1v1 Uno Project!

####-----KNOWN ISSUES------####
1. Skips and Reverses just do no function yet. They do functionally nothing but provide checks. will be left in game in uncompleteted state. 
2. deckReset() Function is dumb and cant see that a card is in the deck variable when it actually is. Causing a crash since it starts complaining that the card it needs to remove isn't there.
